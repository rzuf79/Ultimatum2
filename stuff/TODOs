Piotr's TODOs

v animated tiles (for water and force fields)
v convert all the locations to ascii
v conceive some clever way of looping the overworld maps
v optimize the animated tiles to work with looped maps
- add font (probably cp437)
- microlite20 ruleset
- traveling between locations
- in-game messages (we have to display the magnificent "HEX-E-POO" line somewhere, right?)
- inventory
- character stats
- figure out the most convenient way of putting stuff on maps, like npcs, monsters, doors, planes etc
- some npcs
